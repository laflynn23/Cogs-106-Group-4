# Signal Detection Theory (Object Programming) project, due 2/12/25

This is a collaborative project by Liam Flynn, Jeslyn Bui, Alyssa Mendoza, Mikel Sanchez, and Liam Kennedy.

The .venv folder contains the Python environment. This includes all the dependencies and Python packages needed for the script to run correctly.

In the SignalDetectionAssignment folder, we have our SDT code and the provided test suite. 

We used ChatGPT to help create the Signal Detection code and changed the signal detection test package import to work for our repository.
